## Overview

Merchants have the ability to interact with Kount using Restful Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Restful API access will allow a merchant to programmatically interact with Kount “under the hood” so to speak, bypassing the Agent Web Console (AWC) completely. These systems can be connected to an in-house interface so decisions can be made automatically.

If you request these services, Kount allows you to communicate with our application servers over the internet through a series of notifications and Restful API calls. APIs allow you to send information to Kount, such as adding a large number of email addresses to a VIP list, and receiving a response stating if your changes were successful.

## Kount Environments and Authentication
Kount has separate environments for testing and production. We encourage the use of the Kount Test environment to establish and validate the Restful API Connection.

Test: [https://api.test.kount.net/rpc/v1](https://api.test.kount.net/rpc/v1)

Production: [https://api.kount.net/rpc/v1](https://api.kount.net/rpc/v1)

## Error Codes 
In addition to the general three-digit error codes common with the Kount API endpoints, Kount offers four-digit error codes to provide additional information should a submission from a merchant encounter a problem. See below for a list of these codes. Note that the general format of an error message resembles the following example. In this sample response, the error is "1758 - Incomplete Transaction - Waiting for Update, try again later."

```
{"status":"failure","count":{"success":0,"failure":1},"errors":
[{"code":1758,"msg":"Incomplete transaction - waiting for update, try again later","scope":"AA000A0A0000","type":404}]}
